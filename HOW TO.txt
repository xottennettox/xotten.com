Save your changes in src/App.jsx.
Open PowerShell and go to your project folder:
cd F:\Xotten.com
npm run dev
you will get the local host, check on the website
You’ll see something like:

VITE v5.x  ready
Local: http://localhost:5173/
Open that URL in your browser. 
Changes will auto-reload when you save the file. 
If it doesn’t, press F5 in the browser.

If good, deploy:

git add src\App.jsx
git commit -m "Fix paste issue; remove year; size under title; Home + Portfolio sections"
git push

Handy extras:

Auto-open the browser: npm run dev -- --open

Different port (if 5173 is busy): npm run dev -- --port 5174

Stop the server: press Ctrl+C in the PowerShell window.

Preview the production build (what Netlify serves):

npm run build
npm run preview


Then open the URL it prints (usually http://localhost:4173).



Alt + O on any page → enter your code (same as before).

Or visit https://xotten.com/?owner=universe and me are all aligned


--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Make sure you edited the right file

Open F:\Xotten.com\src\App.jsx in Notepad++.

Quick checks inside the file:

Find Alt + O (secret owner hotkey).

Find the stacked title lines:

Xotten
Elevated
Paintings


Find the component named SectionTitle.

If those aren’t there, you didn’t paste the new file—paste the whole script again and save.

2) Preview locally

In PowerShell:

cd F:\Xotten.com
npm run dev


Open the URL it prints (usually http://localhost:5173/).
On Home you should see the stacked “Xotten / Elevated / Paintings”, and the Owner button is not visible (use Alt + O to unlock owner).

If you don’t see the changes locally:

You’re not in the right folder (make sure package.json is in F:\Xotten.com).

Or the file wasn’t saved. Save and restart npm run dev.

3) Deploy to your site

If local looks good, deploy:

cd F:\Xotten.com
git status
git add src\App.jsx
git commit -m "UI update: stacked title, headings outside panel, panel opacity, faster lightbox"
git push


Then hard-reload your site in the browser (Ctrl+F5).
If it still looks old, open Netlify → Deploys for this site and confirm the latest commit shows as “Published”.

4) Still stuck?

Run these and tell me what they print:

cd F:\Xotten.com
git remote -v
git log -1 --stat


That confirms you pushed to the correct GitHub repo and that src\App.jsx was included in the last deploy.
